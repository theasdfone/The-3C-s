Introducing Toronto’s most innovative renewable energy source that triples as an air filter and an
interactive playground! This ingenious way to attract tourism and experience different cultures
allows for a better and brighter world!<br><br>
The purifier is a hollow shell that pulls in air and puts it through a mesh purifier, thus releasing
clean air. Inspiration was taken from the Dyson air purifier that is notorious for its ease of use
and effectiveness. More importantly, it is extremely user friendly and interactive, which is why it
was decided that the device would have slides running down the sides. The Dyson air purifier
utilises a fan to suck in air and remove up to 99.95% of pollutants. These include excessive
smoke emissions, dust, pollen and other allergens. The purifier uses activated carbon to filter
chemicals and smells that are apparent in the surrounding air. It will help make our quality of life
that much better and promote a decrease in carbon emissions.<br><br>
Now you may be wondering, what will power this? That's the most amazing part! The thermal
energy that is created when the slides located at either side of the purifier are in use is harnessed
to run it. The purifier will run solely on renewable energy sources. In order to ensure this, there
will also be solar panels located at the base and very top of the device.<br><br>
COVID-19 has taken a toll on many industries all around the world, the hope is that this device
will promote tourism to Toronto and even bring locals to it! It is extremely user friendly and acts
as a “three-in-one” to bring in money, clean surrounding air and fight climate change using
renewable energy.

<h2>Technical Aspects</h2>
<p style ="margin-right:150px; font-size:20px">1) Thermal Slides: Directly beneath the stainless steel layer, thermal energy absorbers are present.
Since stainless steel is a conductor, when the sun hits the slide, the thermal energy can reach the
thermal energy absorbers and be transferred into electrical energy by the slide generator.<br>
2) Slide Generator: Transforms thermal energy into electrical energy.<br>
3) Solar Ladder and Platform: For people to climb up and slide down. Beneath the tempered glass,
the solar panels trap solar energy to power the air purifier.<br>
4) Air Purifier: In theory, this would be a collaboration with Dyson and their patented air purifier.<br>
5) Base: Supports the entire structure, and contains internal wiring and programming to run the air
purifying device.<br>
6) Bikes: Outlet for tourists to create kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is converted, and becomes
the primary power source for the air purifying device.<br>
7) Bike Generator: Transforms kinetic energy into electrical energy.<br>
8) Wires: Provide path for electricity to power the air purifier.
